My favourite Disney movie is an obsure one.. but I adore The Emporers New Groove and food features at various points across the movie. Kronk's desire to eat his spinach puffs while Ezma is trying to get rid of Kusco always makes me laugh - so they had to be include in this list of recipes.

## Ingredients

* 4 pieces of bacon
* 225g of cream cheese, cut into chunks
* 2 large eggs 
* 1/2 tsp garlic power
* 1/4 oregano (dried) 
* 1 pack of spinach (280g)
* 55g of feta, crumbled 
* 25g of grated parmesan 
* 2 sheets of pre made/rolled puff pasty 

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C or 180 degrees C fan. Cook the bacon under the grill. Once it has cooled cut it into small pieces. While that is cooking grease 18 muffin tin holes ready to bake the spinach puffs in.
2. Melt the cream cheese in the microwave - you want it to be soft and melted but not steaming. Stir in one egg, the garlic, black pepper and dried oregano until it is all combined. 
3. Combine the feta, spinach, parmesan and bacon in a separate bowl with a fork - this should break apart the spinach. Move the cream cheese mixture into this bowl and combine - at this point taste the mixture and season as desired. 
4. Unroll the pastry nd cut into 9 even squares (approx 3 inches each side). Place each square into the muffin cups - the sides should extent to the top of the cups - you can stretch the pastry slightly so that this happens.
5. Place a heaped tablespoon of the cheese and spinach filling into each of the muffin cups
6. Bring the four points of pastry to the middle so that they a slightly covering the mixture, join them in the centre by pressing down slightly. With the last egg beat it in a small bowl and brush over the tops of the pastry
7. Bake the spinach puffs for 20-25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. After allowing them too cool for 10 minutes - loosen them from the pan by running a knife around the edges gently. Transfer to a wire rack and serve when needed.
