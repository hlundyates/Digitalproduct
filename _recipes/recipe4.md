## Ingredients

* 340g of plain flour
* 60g of caster sugar
* 2 tsp of baking powder 
* 1/2 tsp of bicarbonate of soda
* 1/2 tsp of salt
* 1/2 tsp of nutmeg
* 245g of buttermilk 
* 70g of water
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract
* Vegetable oil for frying (approx 1 bottle)
* Icing sugar for dusting 

## Method

1. In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and nutmeg. 
2. In a large bowl whisk together the buttermilk, water, egg and vanilla extract and then stir in the flour mixture.
3. Dust the work surface and use your hands to pat the dough into a square that is 1/2 an inch thick - if the dough starts to get sticky, then dust the top with flour. Once you have got it to the right thickness cut the dough into 2 and 1/2 inch squares.
4. In a saucepan heat 2 inch of oil (the amount of oil will depend on the size of your pan). Using a cooking thermometer heat the oil to 160°C - regularly test the temperature and turn down or off the heat if it starts to go above this.
5. Carefully move the pieces of dough into the hot oil. Fry for three minutes on each side. Remove them and cool on a wire rack. Dust with icing sugar.
