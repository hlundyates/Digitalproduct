If you ask anyone to name a food from a Disney movie I think they would say Ratatouille.. nothing is more iconic than Remy making this food for Ego! The films version is also unique as the vegetables are sliced rather than chopped. Enjoy!!

## Ingredients

* 2 Aubergines
* 6 Roma (plum) Tomatoes
* 4 Courgettes 

### For the Sauce

* 2 tbs of olive oil
* 1 onion (diced)
* 4 cloves of garlic (minced)
* 1 red pepper (diced)
* 1 yellow pepper (diced)
* 2 cans of chopped tomatoes (800g)
* 8 fresh basil leaves (chopped)

### Herb Seasoning 

* 8 fresh basil leaves (chopped)
* 1 clove of garlic (minced)
* Chopped fresh parsley 
* 2 tsp of dried thyme
* 4 tbs of olive oil

## Method 

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C or 170°C Fan. Begin by slicing the vegetables (tomatoes, aubergines and courgettes into 1 mm rounds and put in a bowl to one side.
2. Then to make the sauce - in a medium pan heat the oil over a medium to high heat, too this add the onion, garlic, and peppers and sauté until softened (about 10 mins). Then add the cans of chopped tomatoes and salt and pepper, stir until combined. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil. Transfer into an oven safe pan and smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.
3. Arrange the vegetables in an alternating pattern (just like Remy!) over the top of the sauce.
4. Now make the herb seasoning by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl. Sprinkle this over the top of the vegetables. 
5. Cover the pan will foil to stop the vegetables from burning and bake for 40 mins. Uncover it and bake for a further 20 minted - this should mean that the vegetables are now softener and ready to eat.
