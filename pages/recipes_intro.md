Disney films are loved by many people across generations. For many years people have dedicated lots of time to replicating the food mentioned in the films and from the Disneyland parks. During the pandemic, social media such as TikTok has further increased this craze for reproducing the food, as people found themselves stuck at home and either missing going to the parks or spent more time watching the films. I have created a collection of six recipes from my favourite Disney films, collated together into this list. There are an equal split of ‘types’ of foods, 3 savoury and 3 desserts. I have given my recipes the collective title of ‘*It’s Always Tea Time*’ this is a quote from Alice in Wonderland.
